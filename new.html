                                    A hackathon is an opportunity to learn new concepts about tech and apply them to some cool ideas. 
                                    These ideas are formulated to create things like websites, apps, or unthinkable solutions to a problem presented by the theme of the hackathon.

                                    Don't worry, you don't have to have experience coding or be an expert with computers to participate, think of it as an opportunity!

                                    Not at all, but there's nothing better than working in a team, right?
                                    We encourage you to form a team of up to 4 people, but if you're confident in your skills or feel that you work better alone, feel free to fly solo!

                                    If you however prefer to be in a team but donâ€™t have a team arranged before the event, we will host a team-forming session at the start of the event.
